# About this folder. 

Most of this code is a follow-along of the [Scrimba course for langchain](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-official-langchainjs-course-c02t). Although Scrimba has a neat browser-based IDE, I wanted the extra challenge of following along in a local environment. 

I am moving these files into this folder to keep the project focused and so as not to interfere with other langchain projects housed in this repo.

These files are good reference, but the course was built using a previous version of langchain. Attempts have been made to update the code to use langchain v0.2
